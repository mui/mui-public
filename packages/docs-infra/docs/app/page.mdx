# Docs Infra Docs

This is the documentation for the MUI Internal Docs Infra package. It provides components and utilities for building documentation sites.

# Components

These usually do not add additional HTML elements to the page, but rather provide functionality to wrap developer provided components.

Some fundamental components are:
- [`CodeHighlighter`](./components/code-highlighter/page.mdx): A component for displaying and rendering code snippets with syntax highlighting.

See the full list of components in the [Components section](./components/page.mdx).

# Hooks

These are React hooks that provide client-side functionality for building documentation sites.

Some fundamental hooks are:
- [`useCode`](./hooks/useCode/page.mdx): A hook for rendering code blocks
- [`useDemo`](./hooks/useDemo/page.mdx): A hook for rendering demos

See the full list of hooks in the [Hooks section](./hooks/page.mdx).

# Functions

These are utility functions that provide functionality outside of React components.

Some fundamental functions are:
- [`resolveDemoImports`](./functions/resolveDemoImports/page.mdx): A function that resolves the imports for a demo source file.

See the full list of functions in the [Functions section](./functions/page.mdx).
