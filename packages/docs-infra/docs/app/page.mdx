This is the documentation for the MUI Internal Docs Infra package. It provides components and utilities for building documentation sites.

You can install this package using:

# Components

These usually do not add additional HTML elements to the page, but rather provide functionality to wrap developer provided components.

Some fundamental components are:
- [`CodeHighlighter`](./components/code-highlighter/page.mdx): A component for displaying and rendering code snippets with syntax highlighting.

See the full list of components in the [Components section](./components/page.mdx).

# Hooks

These are React hooks that provide client-side functionality for building documentation sites.

Some fundamental hooks are:
- [`useCode`](./hooks/use-code/page.mdx): A hook for rendering code blocks
- [`useDemo`](./hooks/use-demo/page.mdx): A hook for rendering demos

See the full list of hooks in the [Hooks section](./hooks/page.mdx).

# Functions

These are utility functions that provide functionality outside of React components.

Some fundamental functions are:
- [`abstractCreateDemo`](./functions/abstract-create-demo/page.mdx) - Factory utilities for creating structured demos that work with CodeHighlighter
- [`loadPrecomputedCodeHighlighter`](./functions/load-precomputed-code-highlighter/page.mdx) - Webpack loader for build-time demo optimization
- [`transformHtmlCode`](./functions/transform-html-code/page.mdx) - Plugin for transforming HTML code blocks into precomputed data structures
- [`transformMarkdownCode`](./functions/transform-markdown-code/page.mdx) - Remark plugin for transforming markdown code blocks with variants into HTML structures

See the full list of functions in the [Functions section](./functions/page.mdx).
