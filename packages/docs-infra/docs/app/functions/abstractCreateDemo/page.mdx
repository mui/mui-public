# Abstract Create Demo

`abstractCreateDemo` is a function that helps you create demos in a structured way, allowing for better organization and optimization of your code.
It is particularly useful when working with the [`CodeHighlighter`](../../components/code-highlighter/page.mdx) component, as it enables you to define the structure and behavior of your demos in a consistent manner.

At the very basic level, the [`loadPrecomputedCodeHighlighter`](../precompute-loader/page.mdx) function expects a factory function with the following signature:

```ts
export const createDemo = (url: string, component: React.ComponentType, options?: any) {
  return () => <>Demo Content</>;
}
```

and when using variants:

```ts
export const createDemoWithVariants = (url: string, variants: Record<string, React.ComponentType>, options?: any) {
  return () => <>Demo Content</>;
}
```

To quickly implement a factory function, you can use the `abstractCreateDemo` function. This function provides a template for creating demos that can be used with the `CodeHighlighter` component.

```ts
import {
  createDemoFactory,
  createDemoWithVariantsFactory,
} from '@mui/internal-docs-infra/abstractCreateDemo';

import { DemoContent } from './DemoContent';

/**
 * Creates a demo component for displaying code examples with syntax highlighting.
 * @param url Depends on `import.meta.url` to determine the source file location.
 * @param component The component to be rendered in the demo.
 * @param meta Additional meta for the demo.
 */
export const createDemo = createDemoFactory({
  DemoContent,
});

/**
 * Creates a demo component for displaying code examples with syntax highlighting.
 * A variant is a different implementation style of the same component.
 * @param url Depends on `import.meta.url` to determine the source file location.
 * @param variants The variants of the component to be rendered in the demo.
 * @param meta Additional meta for the demo.
 */
export const createDemoWithVariants = createDemoWithVariantsFactory({
  DemoContent,
});
```
