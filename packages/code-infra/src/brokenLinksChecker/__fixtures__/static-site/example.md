# Example Markdown File

This is a markdown file with links:

- [Link to valid page](/valid.html)
- [Link to page with anchors](/with-anchors.html#section1)
- [Broken markdown link](/broken-from-markdown.html)

## Markdown Section

This section has an anchor target (`#markdown-section`) generated by rehype-slug.

This is a code block with a link that should NOT be extracted:

```
