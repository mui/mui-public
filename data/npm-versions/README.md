# NPM Download Statistics

This directory contains historical npm download statistics for tracked packages.

⚠️ **DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY** - All files in this directory are automatically generated by a weekly GitHub Action.

## Manual Update

To manually update the statistics, run:

```bash
pnpm collect-npm-stats
```

Edit the `scripts/collect-npm-stats.ts` script to add packages.

## Data Format

Each JSON file contains:

- `package`: Package name
- `timestamps`: Array of collection timestamps (Unix timestamps)
- `downloads`: Object mapping version strings to arrays of download counts

Example structure:

```json
{
  "package": "@mui/material",
  "timestamps": [1234567890, 1234567891],
  "downloads": {
    "5.15.20": [68684, 70000],
    "6.4.12": [263658, 265000],
    "7.1.2": [59370, 60000]
  }
}
```

## Automation

Data is automatically updated every Sunday at midnight UTC by the [NPM Download Statistics workflow](.github/workflows/npm-download-stats.yml).

The workflow fetches the latest weekly download statistics from the npm API and appends them to the historical data for each tracked package.
