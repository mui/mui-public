# Load Server Code Meta

[//]: types.ts '<-- Autogenerated By (do not edit the following markdown directly)'

## createLoadServerCodeMeta

Creates a loadCodeMeta function that resolves variant paths from demo files.

This factory function creates a LoadCodeMeta implementation that:

1. Parses the demo file to find createDemo calls with variants
2. Resolves all variant entry point paths using resolveVariantPaths
3. Returns a Code object mapping variant names to their resolved file URLs

The actual loading, parsing, and transformation of the variants is handled
elsewhere by the CodeHighlighter component using loadVariant.

## CreateLoadCodeMetaOptions

## loadServerCodeMeta

Default loadServerCodeMeta function that resolves variant paths from demo files.
This function is used to load code metadata for demos, specifically resolving paths for variants defined in the demo files.
It reads the demo file, parses it to find `createDemo` calls with variants, and resolves the paths for those variants.
It returns a Code object mapping variant names to their resolved file URLs.

```typescript
  _options: {} | undefined,
) => (url: string) => Promise<Code>
```

type CreateLoadCodeMetaOptions = {};
```

```
