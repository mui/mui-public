# Transform Markdown Blockquote Callouts

The `transformMarkdownBlockquoteCallouts` plugin is a Remark plugin that enables GitHub-style callout blocks in markdown. It transforms blockquotes with special markers (like `> [!NOTE]`) into HTML blockquotes with a `data-callout-type` attribute, making it easy to style and render callouts in your documentation.

## Features

- **GitHub-style callouts**: Supports `[!NOTE]`, `[!TIP]`, `[!IMPORTANT]`, `[!WARNING]`, and `[!CAUTION]` markers
- **HTML data attributes**: Adds `data-callout-type` to blockquotes for easy styling
- **Removes callout marker**: Cleans up the markdown so the marker does not appear in the rendered output
- **Works with multi-paragraph and nested content**
- **Compatible with Next.js, MDX, and unified pipelines**

## Supported Callout Types

| Marker         | Attribute Value |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| `[!NOTE]`      | `note`          |
| `[!TIP]`       | `tip`           |
| `[!IMPORTANT]` | `important`     |
| `[!WARNING]`   | `warning`       |
| `[!CAUTION]`   | `caution`       |

### Default Colors

| Callout Type | Color  |
| ------------ | ------ |
| `note`       | Blue   |
| `tip`        | Green  |
| `important`  | Purple |
| `warning`    | Orange |
| `caution`    | Red    |

> [!NOTE]
> These are the default colors used by GitHub. Colors may vary in your implementation, but try to maintain a similar visual hierarchy.

## Example

### How to Write a Callout in Markdown

```markdown
> [!TIP]
> This is a tip callout. You can use any of the supported callout types:
>
> - [!NOTE]
> - [!TIP]
> - [!IMPORTANT]
> - [!WARNING]
> - [!CAUTION]
>
> The callout marker must be the first text in the blockquote.
```

### Live Callout Examples

> [!NOTE]
> This is a note callout. It uses the `[!NOTE]` marker and renders with a special style.

> [!TIP]
> This is a tip callout. Use tips for helpful suggestions or shortcuts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an important callout. Use for critical information.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a warning callout. Use for potential problems or risks.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a caution callout. Use for things users should be careful about.

You can also have multiple paragraphs:

> [!NOTE]
> This callout has multiple paragraphs.
>
> The second paragraph is also included in the callout.

## Usage

Add the plugin to your unified/remark pipeline:

```ts
import { unified } from 'unified';
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse';
import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype';
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify';
import { transformMarkdownBlockquoteCallouts } from '@mui/internal-docs-infra/pipeline/transformMarkdownBlockquoteCallouts';

const processor = unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(transformMarkdownBlockquoteCallouts)
  .use(remarkRehype)
  .use(rehypeStringify);

const markdown = `
> [!TIP]
> This is a tip!
`;

const html = await processor.process(markdown);
console.log(html.toString());
```

## Integration

This plugin is included by default in the docs-infra markdown pipeline. You can also use it in any unified/remark-based project.

- **Next.js/MDX**: Add to your remarkPlugins array
- **Custom pipelines**: Use as shown above

## Best Practices

1. **Use only supported callout types**: Only the five types above will be recognized and styled
2. **Start callouts at the beginning of a blockquote**: The marker must be the first text in the first paragraph
3. **Use for notes, tips, warnings, and important info**: Reserve callouts for content that needs to stand out
4. **Style callouts in your CSS**: Target `[data-callout-type]` attributes for custom styles
