# Functions

[//]: # 'This file is autogenerated, but the following order can be modified'

- [loadServerSource](./load-server-source/page.mdx) - The utility reads source files and analyzes their dependencies, extracting imports and resolving relative file paths. It processes JavaScript/TypeScript files to build dependency trees and prepare code for documentation and live demos.
- [Abstract Create Demo](./abstract-create-demo/page.mdx) - The function helps you create structured demo factories that work seamlessly with the component ecosystem. It provides a standardized way to create demos that combine component previews with code display, making it easier to build consistent documentation interfaces.
- [transformTypescriptToJavascript](./transform-typescript-to-javascript/page.mdx) - The utility transforms TypeScript/TSX code into JavaScript/JSX using Babel, preserving formatting and automatically generating JavaScript variants for documentation and demos.

- [loadServerCodeMeta](./load-server-code-meta/page.mdx) - The utility parses demo files to extract variant information and resolves file paths for code metadata. It reads demo index files, finds factory calls, and builds a object mapping variant names to their file URLs.
- [transformMarkdownDemoLinks](./transform-markdown-demo-links/page.mdx) - A remark plugin that automatically cleans up "[See Demo]" links and horizontal rules that follow Demo components in markdown documentation. This plugin identifies Demo components (without ) and removes associated navigation elements to create cleaner documentation.
- [Precompute Client Loader](./load-precomputed-code-highlighter-client/page.mdx) - The precompute client loader is a Webpack/Turbopack loader that enables build-time optimization of client-side demo components by processing demo client files and precomputing external dependencies for live editing environments.
- [transformMarkdownMetadata](./transform-markdown-metadata/page.mdx) - A remark plugin that extracts metadata from MDX files and optionally updates parent directory index pages. This plugin automatically collects page titles, descriptions, keywords, hierarchical section structures, and Open Graph data to create searchable, navigable documentation indexes.
- [withDocsInfra](./with-docs-infra/page.mdx) - The `withDocsInfra` function is a Next.js configuration plugin that sets up webpack loaders, Turbopack rules, and page extensions required for MUI docs infrastructure. It automatically configures code highlighting loaders for demo files and provides sensible defaults for documentation sites.
- [transformMarkdownCode](./transform-markdown-code/page.mdx) - A remark plugin that transforms markdown code blocks into HTML structures with enhanced metadata support. This plugin handles both individual code blocks with options and multi-variant code examples. It's the first stage in a processing pipeline, typically followed by for final rendering.
- [transformHtmlCode](./transform-html-code/page.mdx) - A rehype plugin that transforms elements containing blocks into precomputed data for the CodeHighlighter component. This plugin extracts source code from HTML, processes it through syntax highlighting and transformations, then stores the results for efficient client-side rendering.
- [Loader Utilities](./loader-utils/page.mdx) - The loader utilities provide a comprehensive set of functions for resolving, parsing, and processing import statements in JavaScript/TypeScript code. These utilities are essential for building systems that need to analyze and transform code imports, such as code highlighters, bundlers, and documentation generators.
- [parseSource](./parse-source/page.mdx) - The utility parses source code into HAST (Hypertext Abstract Syntax Tree) nodes with syntax highlighting using Starry Night. It converts code into highlighted HTML structures for display in documentation and demos.
