# Docs Infra

This is the documentation for the MUI Internal Docs Infra package. It provides components and utilities for building documentation sites.

You can install this package using:

```bash variant=pnpm
pnpm install @mui/internal-docs-infra
```

```bash variant=yarn
yarn add @mui/internal-docs-infra
```

```bash variant=npm
npm install @mui/internal-docs-infra
```

# Components

These usually do not add additional HTML elements to the page, but rather provide functionality to wrap developer provided components.

Some fundamental components are:

- [`CodeHighlighter`](./components/code-highlighter/page.mdx): A component for displaying and rendering code snippets with syntax highlighting.

See the full list of components in the [Components section](./components/page.mdx).

# Hooks

These are React hooks that provide client-side functionality for building documentation sites.

Some fundamental hooks are:

- [`useCode`](./hooks/use-code/page.mdx): A hook for rendering code blocks
- [`useDemo`](./hooks/use-demo/page.mdx): A hook for rendering demos
- [`useTypes`](./hooks/use-types/page.mdx): A hook for extracting and displaying type information

See the full list of hooks in the [Hooks section](./hooks/page.mdx).

# Functions

These are utility functions that provide functionality outside of React components.

Some fundamental functions are:

- [`abstractCreateDemo`](./functions/abstract-create-demo/page.mdx) - Factory utilities for creating structured demos that work with CodeHighlighter
- [`abstractCreateTypes`](./functions/abstract-create-types/page.mdx) - Factory utilities for creating type documentation components
- [`loadPrecomputedCodeHighlighter`](./functions/load-precomputed-code-highlighter/page.mdx) - Webpack loader for build-time demo optimization
- [`transformMarkdownCode`](./functions/transform-markdown-code/page.mdx) - Remark plugin for transforming markdown code blocks with variants into HTML structures
- [`loadPrecomputedTypesMeta`](./functions/load-precomputed-types-meta/page.mdx) - Webpack loader for build-time type extraction and analysis
- [`transformMarkdownRelativePaths`](./transform-markdown-relative-paths/page.mdx) - Remark plugin for transforming relative markdown links to absolute paths

See the full list of functions in the [Functions section](./functions/page.mdx).

# Patterns

These are architectural patterns and best practices for building documentation infrastructure.

Some key patterns are:

- [`Built Factories`](./patterns/built-factories/page.mdx): A pattern for creating factory functions that use `import.meta.url` as a starting point for operations.
- [`Props Context Layering`](./patterns/props-context-layering/page.mdx): A pattern for creating isomorphic components with React Server Components using context layering.

See the full list of patterns in the [Patterns section](./patterns/page.mdx).
