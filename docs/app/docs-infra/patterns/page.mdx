- [Props Context Layering](./props-context-layering/page.mdx) - **Purpose**: Enable isomorphic components to work seamlessly with React Server Components while maintaining a single, ergonomic API.
- [Built Factories Pattern](./built-factories/page.mdx) - At its core, a factory only needs a URL. In TypeScript we can rely on `import.meta.url` as the starting point for any operation.

## Built Factories Pattern

At its core, a factory only needs a URL. In TypeScript we can rely on `import.meta.url` as the starting point for any operation.
