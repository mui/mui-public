## Code Highlighter

The `CodeHighlighter` component provides a powerful and flexible way to display interactive code examples with syntax highlighting, multiple variants, and live previews.
It supports both static code blocks and interactive demos with component previews.

## Code Provider

The `CodeProvider` component provides client-side functions for fetching source code and highlighting it. It's designed for cases where you need to render code blocks or demos based on client-side state or dynamic content loading. It also provides heavy processing functions that are moved from individual components to the context for better performance and code splitting.

## Code Externals Context

The `CodeExternalsContext` is a simple React context that provides access to external dependencies (modules and components) for demo components. It's primarily used internally by demo client providers created with [`abstractCreateDemoClient`](../../factories/abstract-create-demo-client/page.mdx) to make precomputed externals available to child components.
