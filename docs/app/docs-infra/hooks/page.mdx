# Hooks

[//]: # 'This file is autogenerated, but the following order can be modified'

- [useUrlHashState](./use-url-hash-state/page.mdx) - The `useUrlHashState` hook provides a simple way to synchronize component state with the URL hash fragment, enabling deep linking, state persistence, and browser navigation support in documentation and demo pages.
- [useCode Hook](./use-code/page.mdx) - The `useCode` hook provides programmatic access to code display, editing, and transformation functionality within `CodeHighlighter` components. It's designed for scenarios where you need fine-grained control over code behavior or want to build custom code interfaces that focus purely on code management, without component rendering.
- [usePreference](./use-preference/page.mdx) - The `usePreference` hook provides specialized preference management for code demo variants and transformations. It builds on `useLocalStorageState` with intelligent storage key generation, prefix support, and automatic optimization for single-option scenarios.
- [useCopier](./use-copier/page.mdx) - The `useCopier` hook provides robust clipboard copy functionality with success state management, error handling, and customizable callbacks. It's designed for code blocks, buttons, and interactive elements that need copy-to-clipboard functionality.
- [useLocalStorageState](./use-local-storage-state/page.mdx) - The `useLocalStorageState` hook provides persistent state management using localStorage with cross-tab synchronization, server-side rendering support, and a useState-like API. It's designed for user preferences, demo state, and any data that should persist across browser sessions.
- [useDemo Hook](./use-demo/page.mdx) - The `useDemo` hook extends `useCode` functionality to provide a complete demo rendering solution that combines component previews with code display. It's specifically designed for creating interactive demonstrations where users can see both working React components and their source code.
- [useErrors](./use-errors/page.mdx) - The `useErrors` hook provides access to error state in an isomorphic error handling system. It implements the [Props Context Layering pattern](../../patterns/props-context-layering/page.mdx) to work seamlessly across server and client boundaries, making it ideal for code highlighting and interactive demos that need robust error handling.
