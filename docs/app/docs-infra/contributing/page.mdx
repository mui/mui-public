## File Conventions

This has some extensions of the [Next.js Filesystem conventions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions).
These patterns apply over the `app` directory, allowing special behavior on the loading of these files.

import { FileConventions } from '@/components/FileConventions';

<FileConventions />

TODO: The current file conventions can also be checked by running `pnpm run check:conventions` within the docs directory.
